TSS_HG38: a file that contains the transcription starting site (position) of genes in HG38 (with refseq id)   


Common peaks between TET2 and PR are found by seeing which PR chip seq peaks appears in TET2 chip seq peaks
# if starting site of PR peaks is within 200 kb range of a TET2 peak starting site, then we consider them to be overlapping.  


Putative genes files contain  outputs to a file containing genes that have PR/TET2 ChIP-seq peak (in this case, stronger peak in tumor) within 3KB + / - from the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene
